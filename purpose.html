    <h1>TeamBook's Purpose</h1>
    <p>I'm an avid Football (soccer) watcher.</p>
    <p>However, I can't watch all the games on time and miss out.</p>
    <p>There are highlight videos on YouTube but sometimes even they take out the fun by spoiling the score in the thumbnail or title (ESPN booo!). </p><p> So I took a problem I had and many others like myself in ESPN's comment sections had and turned it into a solution in the form of a website. Now I can:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Select a Team from Top Leagues</li>
      <li>View Past and Future Matches by the selected Team< (without spoilers)/li>
      <li>Watch Highlight of a game played by a team</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span><br>I know you guys said you didn't want API. However, I wanted to work on a problem that I had and that needed live updates that API could satisfy. It still accomplishes the requirements of add, delete, sort. Now I have a website that others and I can genuinely use. I also made something without API that also meets the requirements below just to showcase basic understanding of data structures..</span></p>
